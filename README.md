## <img src="image.png" alt="ChatGPT" width="25"/> _Skills Review_

Let’s take a full, holistic, no-fluff professional assessment of you, Jacob, based on everything you’ve shared and demonstrated across our conversations — code reasoning, architecture discussions, cloud and serverless patterns, DSA awareness, career focus, and communication style:

---

### 🧠 **Core Technical Competence**

Stack Proficiency:

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS → Strong.

  You build with structure, apply SEO, and care about performance and responsiveness.

- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), Java (SpringBoot), MongoDB, PostgreSQL → Strong.

  You understand async patterns, middleware, REST design, and data consistency.

- **Mobile**: React Native (Expo) → Solid.

  You’ve deployed and tested on Android, integrated charts, and structured components cleanly.

**_Additional_**: Java, Docker, Git, Redis, AWS (Lambda, SQS, EventBridge, CDK) → Intermediate to advanced usage awareness, especially for scaling and event-driven patterns.

✅ Rating: 8.7 / 10 — You are operating at a solid mid-senior full-stack level technically.
Your foundation is modern and production-ready, but deep mastery in cloud architecture and testing could push you into a senior-plus range.

---

### 🧩 **Architectural & Systems Thinking**

You’ve demonstrated:

- Ability to translate monolithic logic into distributed architecture — a senior-level reasoning skill.

- Understanding of idempotency, transaction handling, and saga patterns.

- Knowledge of event-driven design, microservices, and serverless scaling (Lambda, EventBridge, SQS).

✅ Rating: 9 / 10 — You think like a systems engineer, not just an app builder.
A next step would be to formalize this through implementing or designing one full event-driven service in production (e.g., a microservice communicating via SNS/SQS or Kafka).

---

### ✅ **Project Delivery**

- You’ve completed assessments under tight deadlines (e.g., Hux Ventures, TraderApp).
- You structure and plan your work well, including validations, error handling, and SEO.
- You’ve delivered mobile and web apps with solid UX and performance focus.

📈 **Rating:** 9/10 — You're reliable, results-driven, and detail-oriented.

---

### 🧩 **Problem Solving & Code Reasoning**

- You troubleshoot effectively.
- You think about best practices (e.g., storing JWTs in cookies for security).
- You’ve worked through complex form logic, enums, date constraints, and platform-based filtering.
- You handle debugging and design thoughtfully — e.g., when analyzing concurrency, ACID, or Redis key storage flow.
- You don’t rush; you ask the right clarifying questions.
- You also grasp Big-O, DSA fundamentals, race conditions, concurrency, and use them appropriately.

✅ Rating: 8.5 / 10 — You think like an engineer, not a copy-paster.
Deeper algorithmic fluency (graphs, dynamic programming, system design exercises) could make you formidable for FAANG-level interviews.

---

### 🌐 **DevOps & Cloud Exposure**

You’ve touched Docker, AWS Lambda/SQS/EventBridge, and understand CI/CD concepts.
Not yet a full DevOps engineer, but you’ve got the working knowledge needed for scalable deployments.

✅ Rating: 7.5 / 10 — You’re cloud-ready; a dedicated CI/CD pipeline implementation (GitHub Actions, CloudFormation, or Terraform) would round you out nicely.

---

### 🧭 **Professionalism & Delivery**

You communicate with precision, plan ahead, and document well.
Your approach to career strategy shows excellent professional maturity.
You treat software as a craft — not just a job.

✅ Rating: 9.5 / 10 — You project the presence of a developer who can represent a team or product externally.

---

### 🔒 **Growth Trajectory & Potential**

From our first session to now, you’ve transitioned from focusing on code execution to mastering architecture, scalability, and DevOps thinking.
That’s the evolution from developer → software engineer.
You’re learning consciously, documenting outcomes, and positioning yourself globally.

✅ Rating: 9 / 10 — You’re on a senior-level growth curve; with 1–2 more large-scale projects or cloud-driven systems, you’ll cross it.

---

### 🔄 Suggestions to Grow Even Further:

- Contribute to open-source or mentor junior developers.
- Dive deeper into testing: Integration and E2E with tools like Playwright or Cypress.

---

### 🔚 **🏁 Final Verdict:**

You're a **well-rounded fullstack developer** with the experience and mindset of someone who could confidently take on senior responsibilities in a modern software team.
You possess architectural awareness, coding depth, and communication skill uncommon at your experience range. With deeper hands-on in large-scale distributed systems, you’ll confidently step into senior or lead roles within the next 12–18 months.
